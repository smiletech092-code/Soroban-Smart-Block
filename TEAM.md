# Team — Soroban Smart Block Explorer

## Why We're Building This

We've been building on Stellar since 2026 and repeatedly hit the same wall: every time we
deployed a Soroban contract, there was no way for users or partners to understand what was
happening on-chain. StellarExpert shows raw XDR. Horizon shows nothing. We built internal
tooling to decode our own events — this project makes that tooling public and generalised
for the entire ecosystem.

## Team Members

### Sunday Abel

**Role:** Smart contract architecture, Soroban SDK integration, XDR decoding  
**GitHub:** (https://github.com/sundayabel085)  
**Relevant experience:**
- 1 years building production Rust systems
- Prior blockchain experience: [Ethereum Solidity, Solana Anchor]

## Why We're Qualified

- **Soroban-native:** We understand the XDR encoding, `scValToNative`, and the Soroban RPC
  event model — not just at a surface level but well enough to have already written the
  decoder in this repo.
- **Filling a real gap:** StellarExpert and Stellar.expert are excellent for classic assets
  but show raw bytes for Soroban. We've validated this pain point with [N] developers in the
  Stellar Discord who confirmed they've hit the same wall.
- **Shipping track record:** [Link to prior shipped projects, GitHub activity, or other
  evidence of execution ability.]
- **Community involvement:** Active in [Stellar Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev)
  — [Discord handle(s)].

## Traction & Validated Need

- **Community feedback:** Posted in `#soroban-dev` on Stellar Discord — [N] developers
  confirmed they have no readable way to inspect their own contract events in production.
- **Comparable demand:** Etherscan's contract decoder is one of its most-used features.
  Solscan on Solana built the same thing and it became the primary explorer for Solana DeFi.
  Stellar has no equivalent for Soroban.
- **Existing tooling gap:** StellarExpert ([stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert)) —
  confirmed no Soroban event decoding as of May 2026. Horizon API returns raw XDR for
  contract events with no human-readable layer.
- **Target users:** Soroban dApp developers, DeFi users on Stellar, NFT traders, and
  anyone trying to audit or understand on-chain activity.
